## Platform Considerations

Prompt engineering considerations can vary slightly depending on the specific platform or LLM API you are using. Some platforms may have specific formatting requirements, token limits, or support for certain prompting techniques. Consult the documentation for the platform you are using for details.

Here's a summary of platform-specific considerations for some popular LLM platforms:

*   **Google Gemini:**

    *   Supports a wide range of prompting techniques, including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting.
    *   Offers a user-friendly interface for experimenting with prompts and analyzing results.
    *   Provides access to a variety of pre-trained LLMs with different capabilities.
    *   **Token Limits:** Be mindful of input and output token limits.  Longer prompts may need to be truncated.
    *   **Example:** `You are a helpful AI assistant. Summarize the following article in three sentences: [article text]`
    *   **Advanced Usage:** Gemini models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, allowing for even more tailored responses.

*   **ChatGPT:**

    *   Known for its conversational abilities and its ability to generate creative and engaging content.
    *   Supports a variety of prompting techniques, including persona-based prompting and constraint setting.
    *   Has a token limit for both input and output, so it's important to keep prompts concise.
    *   **Example:** `Write a poem in the style of Shakespeare about the beauty of nature.`
    *   **Conversation History:** ChatGPT maintains a conversation history, so previous prompts and responses can influence subsequent interactions.  Be mindful of this context.
    *   **API Parameters:**  The ChatGPT API offers parameters like `temperature` and `top_p` to control the randomness and diversity of the generated text.

*   **Claude (Anthropic):**

    *   Focuses on safety and reliability, and it's designed to avoid generating harmful or biased content.
    *   Supports a variety of prompting techniques, including retrieval-augmented generation.
    *   Offers a clear and transparent API for developers.
    *   **Example:** `Answer the following question using information from the provided document: [question] [document]`
    *   **Constitutional AI:** Claude is trained using Constitutional AI, which emphasizes helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness.
    *   **Context Window:** Claude has a large context window, allowing it to process longer documents and conversations.
    *   **Documentation:** [https://docs.anthropic.com/](https://docs.anthropic.com/)

*   **Microsoft Copilot:**

    *   Integrated into Microsoft products like Windows and Office.
    *   Offers a range of features, including text generation, summarization, and code completion.
    *   Supports a variety of prompting techniques, including program-aided language models.
    *   **Example:** `Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number.`
    *   **Contextual Awareness:** Copilot leverages the context of your current work (e.g., the document you're editing) to provide more relevant suggestions.
    *   **Integration with Microsoft Graph:** Copilot can access information from your Microsoft Graph (e.g., emails, calendar) to personalize its responses.
    *   **Documentation:** [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/)

* **Cohere**
    * Offers a range of models, including generation and representation (for embeddings).
    * Supports various prompting techniques and has a focus on enterprise applications.
    * Provides tools for RAG and custom model training.

**Prompt Transferability:**

Prompts that work well on one platform *may not* always work well on others. This is due to differences in:

*   **Model Training:** Different LLMs are trained on different datasets and with different architectures.
*   **Fine-tuning:** Platforms may fine-tune their models for specific tasks or styles.
*   **System Instructions:** The default system instructions (if any) can vary between platforms.
*   **API Parameters:** Different platforms may have different parameters and default settings.

It's often necessary to adapt and refine prompts when switching between platforms.
