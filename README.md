# System Instructions and Prompts

This repository is a curated collection of system instructions and prompts for large language models (LLMs), designed to help you unlock the full potential of AI. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, you'll find valuable resources and examples to guide you in crafting effective instructions and prompts for various tasks and applications.

## What are System Instructions and Prompts?

**System Instructions:** System instructions define the overall behavior and persona of an LLM. They provide the foundational context, constraints, and expectations that govern how the model responds to individual prompts. Think of them as the "operating manual" for the AI.

**Prompts:** Prompts are specific requests or questions posed to the model. They trigger a particular response based on the context provided by the system instructions. Think of them as individual commands or tasks.

This repository provides examples of both system instructions and prompts, demonstrating how they work together to achieve desired outcomes.

## Repository Structure

*   **`system-instructions`:** This directory contains examples of system instructions.
*   **`documentation`:** This directory contains comprehensive documentation and guides on system instruction and prompt engineering. It covers everything from fundamental principles to advanced techniques and best practices. The files included are:
    *   `PE_Advanced_Techniques.md`:  Explores advanced prompting methods like Chain-of-Thought, Tree of Thoughts, ReAct, and more.
    *   `PE_Basic_Techniques.md`: Covers fundamental prompting techniques like specificity, context setting, and persona-based prompting.
    *   `PE_Best_Practices.md`:  Provides a checklist of best practices for effective prompt engineering.
    *   `PE_Further_Reading.md`: Links to external resources, research papers, and articles.
    *   `PE_Glossary.md`:  Defines key terms related to prompt engineering and LLMs.
    *   `PE_Overview.md`:  Provides a high-level introduction to prompt engineering.
    *   `PE_Platform_Considerations.md`: Discusses platform-specific considerations for various LLM providers (e.g., Google Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude).
    *   `PE_Troubleshooting.md`:  Offers guidance on diagnosing and addressing common problems with LLM outputs.
    *   `SIE_Overview.md`: Introduces the concept of System Instruction Engineering.
    * `system_instruction_engineering.md`: Further explains system instruction with examples.

## How to Use This Repository

1.  **Browse Documentation:** Start by exploring the `documentation` directory to gain a solid understanding of prompt engineering and system instruction principles. The `PE_Overview.md` and `SIE_Overview.md` files are good starting points.
2.  **Explore Examples:** Currently, this repository focuses on providing comprehensive documentation. While there is a `system-instructions` directory, the primary resource is the detailed documentation.
3.  **Adapt and Experiment:** Use the documentation and principles to create your prompts and system instructions. Experiment with different variations to see how they affect the LLM's output.
4.  **Contribute:** We encourage contributions from the community!

## Getting Started
