# Awesome System Instructions and Prompts

This repository is a curated collection of system instructions and prompts for large language models (LLMs), designed to help you unlock the full potential of AI. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, you'll find valuable resources and examples to guide you in crafting effective instructions and prompts for various tasks and applications.

## What are System Instructions and Prompts?

**System Instructions:**  System instructions define the overall behavior and persona of an LLM. They provide the foundational context, constraints, and expectations that govern how the model responds to individual prompts. Think of them as the "operating manual" for the AI.

**Prompts:** Prompts are specific requests or questions posed to the model. They trigger a particular response based on the context provided by the system instructions.  Think of them as individual commands or tasks.

This repository provides examples of both system instructions and prompts, demonstrating how they work together to achieve desired outcomes.

## Repository Structure

* **`system-instructions`:** This directory contains examples of system instructions for various personas, tasks, and constraints.  Each subdirectory focuses on a specific category (e.g., `personas`, `tasks`, `constraints`).
* **`prompts`:** This directory contains examples of prompts designed to work with the corresponding system instructions.  The subdirectories mirror the structure of the `system-instructions` directory.
* **`documentation`:** This directory contains documentation and guides on system instruction and prompt engineering principles, best practices, and advanced techniques.
* **`resources`:** This directory contains links to external resources, research papers, and articles related to prompt engineering.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse Examples:** Explore the `system-instructions` and `prompts` directories to find examples relevant to your needs.
2. **Read Explanations:** Each example includes a detailed explanation of its purpose, target audience, key considerations, and potential pitfalls.
3. **Adapt and Experiment:**  Feel free to adapt the examples to your specific use case. Experiment with different variations to see how they affect the LLM's output.
4. **Contribute:**  We encourage contributions from the community!  See the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for guidelines on how to submit new examples or improvements.
